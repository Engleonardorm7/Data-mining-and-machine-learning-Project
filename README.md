# Predictive Maintenance Project

This repository contains the project for the **Data Mining and Machine Learning** lecture. The project focuses on **Predictive Maintenance** approaches, specifically **Condition Monitoring** and **Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction**. The project is divided into two main folders: **Health Monitoring** and **RUL**. Each folder contains the corresponding code notebooks, PDFs, and datasets.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **Health Monitoring Folder**

In this folder, you will find the following files related to **Condition Monitoring**:

- **HealthMonitoring.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the health monitoring approach.
- **HealthMonitoring.pdf**: A PDF version of the notebook for easier viewing.
- **data.csv**: The dataset used for the health monitoring approach, sourced from Kaggle.

### 2. **RUL Folder**

In this folder, you will find the following files related to the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction** approach:

- **Battery_Data_Cleaned.csv**: The cleaned dataset for the RUL approach, sourced from Kaggle.
- **RUL.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system.
- **RUL.pdf**: A PDF version of the notebook for easier viewing.
